it's been a while now when I stopped learning git. I had one of my colleagues five years ago explain to me the git and the github.

but when the many people use git now, I forced myself to learn it. I kinda have a idea how git works but never had the chance to use it and come up with a purpose to use it. 

fortunately, the freecodecamp posted a youtube video that helped me push myself to learn git. I'm referring to this video https://youtu.be/zTjRZNkhiEU

finally, it's I can tell to myself that I know what git is and how it can help me to manage my daily documentation. every day, i will push updates from my journey in cyber security. 

though, i may not use git as what majority of the people do it, like merging, or rebase, at least i know the basics. i'm good with that for now.

overall, im happy with the progress i've made so far. 

cheers.
