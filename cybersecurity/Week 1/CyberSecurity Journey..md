The goal of this platform is to document the journey of me becoming a cyber security analyst. The journey will be a long. I'm here to enjoy every moment. 

As  I write this, I think about my future. I just want to make my daily 8-hour journey worthwhile.

This for my family and my future family.

THIS IS THE CAREER PATH GUIDE. AGAIN THIS IS JUST A GUIDE.
